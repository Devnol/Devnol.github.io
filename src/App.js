  <div id="Info">
    <p>I am a 14 year old student, born and raised in Greece.</p>
    <p> I always had an attraction to computers and loved learning about new technologies and innovations and playing around with both software and hardware.</p>
    <p> I'm a member of the <a href="https://hackropolis.club" className="App-link">Hackropolis</a> club, part of <a href="https://hackclub.com" className="App-link">Hack Club</a>, a nonprofit network of high school coding clubs and makers around the world.</p>

const whatIDo = 
  <div id="Info">
    <p>I enjoy coding and learning something new every day.</p>
    <p>In the past, I have created several projects using several technologies such as games with Unity, hardware automations with Raspberry Pi and Arduino and bots for Discord using Discord.js. I don't like staying on one thing for long though so I haven't created any large projects as of now, though I'd love to make something of a larger scale.</p>
    <p>Another thing I like is designing hardware as well as soldering or prototyping circuits.</p>
    <p>I like gaming but I'm pretty bad at it so I don't play games often. When I do however, I prefer retro classics rather than modern triple-A titles because I prefer their art style and simplicity.</p>
